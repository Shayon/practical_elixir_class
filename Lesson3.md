# Lesson 3

* Everything is a process
* Processes are strongly isolated
* Process creation and destruction is a lightweight operation.
* Message passing is the only way for processes to interact.
* Processes have unique names.
* If you know the name of a process you can send it a message.
* Processes share no resources.
* Error handling is non-local.
* Processes do what they are supposed to do or fail.
